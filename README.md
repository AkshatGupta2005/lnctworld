# LNCT World ðŸš€

Welcome to **LNCT World** â€“ a dynamic digital platform that showcases the legacy, academic excellence, and innovative facilities of LNCT institutions across India. This repository contains all the source code needed to run this modern, interactive website built with React, Vite, and several cutting-edge libraries.

---

## Introduction

**LNCT World** is designed to offer an engaging experience for prospective students, educators, and visitors. The site is a one-stop destination featuring detailed sections about colleges and universities, digital and academic portals, schools, industries, and campus life. With immersive animations powered by Framer Motion, interactive 3D visualizations using Three.js, and responsive maps through Google Maps integrations, LNCT World perfectly combines technology with educational excellence.

The repository is structured with a client-side React codebase (using Vite for fast builds) in the `src/` folder and a server-side integration (utilizing Express, Nodemailer, Multer, PostgreSQL libraries, etc.) in the `server/` directory. You can review the source in files like `src/pages/HomePage.jsx`, `src/pages/CollegesPage.jsx`, and the backend configuration in `server/` directories.

## Features

- **Multi-Page Navigation**: Experience a comprehensive layout that includes Home, About, Colleges, Digital Portals, Schools, Industries, and Contact pages.
- **Interactive Animations**: Enjoy smooth transitions and engaging animations via Framer Motion on key sections such as the hero banner, leader slider, and campus carousel.
- **3D Visualizations**: The Home page features a detailed 3D Earth animation implemented with Three.js to provide a futuristic touch.
- **Responsive Maps**: Embed interactive campus locations using a custom map section powered by Google Maps.
- **Server-Side Integrations**: Includes mailing capability via Nodemailer, file uploads using Multer and PostgreSQL connections for robust data handling.
- **Clean Code & Linting**: Adheres to modern ES modules with ESLint configurations to ensure consistent code quality (see `eslint.config.js`).
